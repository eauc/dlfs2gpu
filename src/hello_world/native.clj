;; We create two matrices...
(def a (dge 2 3 [1 2 3 4 5 6]))
(def b (dge 3 2 [1 3 5 7 9 11]))
;; ... and multiply them
(mm a b)

;; If you see something like this:
;; #RealGEMatrix[double, mxn:2x2, layout:column, offset:0]
;; ▥       ↓       ↓       ┓
;; →       35.0    89.0
;; →       44.0   116.0
;; ┗                       ┛
;; It means that everything is set up and you can enjoy programming with Neanderthal :)
